// **New Hellequin's Cheatsheets** //

These cheatsheets were put together while learning to code using online training materials and collating basic commands into central documents for ease of reference.

These are not aimed for seasoned / experienced coders.

Recommendations on better, simpler or updated syntax is welcome.

Current Cheetshets:

- cheatsheets.md (main git quick guide)
- what-array.md (JavaScript array guide)
- vim (coming soon!)


- old_versions.md (original collection when coding with VS Code - very early on)
